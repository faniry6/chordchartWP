# ChordChartWP
This is a wordpress shortchord for the javascript library chordography2 (https://chordography2.blogspot.com/). It is easy to use, plug and go, and can be intensively costumized with several parameters. 

### Prerequisites
This is a wordpress plugin. So you need to have a self hosted wordpress to be able to use it. Also the chordography2 uses the latest version of javascript language style so your browser should support variable declaration such as let and so one. 

### Installation
Just download the folder and either add it via the plugin manager in web interface or upload it via Ftp. 

### Usage
The usage and sample example can be found via the following link.

### TODOs and Contribute
I wrote this mostly for guitar. So the provided database for quick chord look up is based on guitar. It would be nice to have first a "full" database of common chord chart not only for guitar but for any fretted string instrument e.g Ukulele and Banjo...
If you would like to contribute, then just do a pull request :)
